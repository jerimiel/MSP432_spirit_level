This is a project carried out for the embedded systems and programming course of MAS mechatronics and robotics ETH zurich.
The Project makes use of the MSP432 development board and the BMI160 accelerometer sensor to make an electronic spirit level. By using the inertial readings provided by the accelerometer, the orientation of the setup is calculated and communicated to the user.
